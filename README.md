In this project, the different crimes recorded in different US cities are being analyzed. 
PCA was used to reduce the number of dimensions in this dataset.
Then, two clustering techniques were used, namely KMeans and Agglomerative clustering. 
Clustering silhouette scores were compared between the two models.

The USArrest csv file is included in this repo.
